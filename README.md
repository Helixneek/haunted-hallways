# Haunted Hallways (2023)
Haunted Hallways is a side-scrolling horror game where you have to collect evidence of a murder in a school. The player must explore each room of the school to find proof and items related to the incident, such as security tapes, notes, etc. However, the player is constantly pursued by a ghost that intends to kill them. The player has to collect the items and escape before they are caught.

This game takes place in a dilapidated school. The school was closed under the pretense of a murder. A female student was killed by the principal to fuel his demonic rituals. But, in a moment of surprise, the student manifested as a ghost and killed the principal. This incident caused mass hysteria and quickly led to the abandonment of the school.

This game features:
- **Eerie Atmosphere**: A hauntingly detailed school environment with dimly lit hallways, flickering lights, and unsettling ambient sounds to create a foreboding atmosphere.
- **Evidence Collection**: Players must search for and collect clues, documents, and items scattered throughout the school to piece together the murder mystery.
- **Ghost Pursuit**: An intelligent AI-controlled ghost that relentlessly chases the player, increasing tension and requiring strategic evasion.
- **Immersive Sound Design**: High-quality audio effects and a haunting soundtrack to enhance the immersion and fear factor.

This game was made for the GEMASTIK 2023 Game Development competition.
